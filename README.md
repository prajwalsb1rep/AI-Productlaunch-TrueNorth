##  Overview
**True North** is a proprietary market intelligence system developed by **Prajwal Labs**. It is designed to give Product Managers an unfair advantage by autonomously researching competitors and tracking market signals in real-time.

Instead of generic searches, True North employs a **Multi-Agent Cognitive Architecture** that simulates a team of expert analysts:

### 🤖 The Agent Squad
* **Strategy Agent:** Deconstructs competitor positioning, uncovers feature gaps, and analyzes official roadmaps.
* **Sentiment Agent:** Filters out marketing noise to find raw, unfiltered user feedback on platforms like Reddit, G2, and Capterra.
* **Metrics Agent:** Hunts for elusive financial signals, pricing models, and user growth statistics that are often hidden.

## 🛠️ Technology
This system is built on a custom agentic workflow optimized for deep research:

* **Core Engine:** Custom Python Agentic Architecture
* **Interface:** Streamlit Enterprise UI
* **Search Intelligence:** Deep Web Search (Lite Backend)
* **Data Extraction:** Headless Chromium Scraper
* **Cognitive Model:** Llama 3.3 70B (via Groq Inference)
